###EXPERIENCE

####**Katholieke Universiteit (KU)** 			     
Leuven, Belgium, 
</br>05/2017 - 07/2017 and 12/2017 - 01/2018
</br>Visiting Scholar, Department of Biology					           
Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology, Evolution and Conservation

* Carried out the RNA-Seq data analysis of a natural Daphnia magna population that was under varying predation pressure during a period of about sixteen years.

* Short read mapping and variant calling of the paired end reads was carried out following which a quality check was done using Principal Component Analysis, Concordance Analysis and VCF tools.
Reaction norms approach has been carried out for further analysis as part of the Bachelor’s Thesis Project.

####**Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc)**
Karnataka, India
</br>05/2016 - 07/2016 
</br>Summer Research Fellow, Department of Biochemistry

* Investigated the possible mechanism behind limiting the spread of rDNA silencing at the RDN1 left boundary on yeast chromosome XII.

* Cloned a 600bp fragment to KanMX6 and then sub-cloned it into the plasmid pRO363 to check whether barrier activity is sequence specific or size dependent by analysing the mating efficiency of transformed yeast cells.
