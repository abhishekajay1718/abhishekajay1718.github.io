###EXPERIENCE

####**Katholieke Universiteit (KU)** 			     
Leuven, Belgium
<p style="text-align:left;">
Visiting Scholar, Department of Biology
<span style="float:right;">05/2017 - 07/2017 and 12/2017 - 01/2018</span>
</br>Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology, Evolution and Conservation
</p>

* Carried out data analysis of high throughput transcriptomics data of a natural Daphnia magna population that was under varying predation pressure during a period of sixteen years.

* Computed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Concordance Analysis and VCF tools for quality check.

* Produced visualisations such as reaction norms to understand the variation in gene expression over time.

####**Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc)**
Karnataka, India
<p style="text-align:left;">
Summer Research Fellow, Department of Biochemistry
<span style="float:right;">05/2016 - 07/2016 </span>
</p>

* Investigated the possible mechanism behind limiting the spread of rDNA silencing at the RDN1 left boundary on yeast chromosome XII.

* Cloned a 600bp fragment to KanMX6 and then sub-cloned it into the plasmid pRO363 to check whether barrier activity is sequence specific or size dependent by analysing the mating efficiency of transformed yeast cells.
